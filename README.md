# AllstateClaimsSeverity

This was a machine learning compettition on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity), and I ranked 2038 out of 3055.
I wanted to solidify my knowledge of the neural networks at that time, so I implemented the Neural Network regressor and classifier on my own and used them in the competition.
